Patterns need to be a child of the par_pattern object.

par_pattern acts as a collective obj for patterns in cases where all of them may be needed.
e.g. end_turn destroying all patterns.

A pattern can be used to create more patterns which allows for a single pattern to contain random attack
patterns, run patterns sequentially, or run mutple patterns for mutiple enemies.
